#Question :- Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples
              Sample List : [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]



#solution:-

lst=[(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]
d={}
for i in lst:
    d[i[1]]=i   
a=[]
for i in sorted(d.keys()):
    a.append(d[i])
print(a)

#output :- [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]
